# TI-TOE GAME     

* By: Derek Steinmoeller

This is a simple one-player Tic Tac Toe game for the TI-83 Plus
(Texas Instruments Graphing Calculator)

It was made using TI-BASIC and once is transmitted to the calculator
can be ran with the command "prgmTITOE".

Included in the grouped file "dist/Titoe.8xg" are "titoe.8xp" and "Zai.8xp"
Both are needed on your calculator in order to play Ti-Toe.
(Also included is dist/Titoescr.tif, a screenshot if you want a preview)

The game requires about 11k of free RAM (10850 bytes more precisely)

## How to Play

After you run the program with "prgrmTITOE" you are prompted with a
menu, use this to select your difficulty.  Press 1 for "Super Easy"
or Press 2 for "Very Hard"

After you've selected a difficulty you will then be prompted with an
intro screen. After reading, simply press "Enter" to continue.

Now on the graph screen, a Tic-Tac-Toe board is displayed, to make a 
move, press keys on your number pad (white keys excluding the bottom
row).

Pretend the Tic Tac Toe grid is like your number pad, like so:

                         7 | 8 | 9
                        -----------
                         4 | 5 | 6
                        -----------
                         1 | 2 | 3

After you select the move, the AI player must make a move. This can
take anywhere between 1 and 20 seconds.

The rest is self-explanatory, if you have any questions e-mail me at

Have Fun,
